Module Eight Journal

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

The projects goals were designing, implementing, and evaluating data structures to store, retrieve, and display course information. The challenge was to determine the most efficient structure for operations such as loading, searching, and printing data while meeting functional requirements.
	
**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

I was able to implement vector, hash table, and binary search tree solutions to perform the same operations. I then analyzed their run time and memory usage. This allowed me to compare trade offs in performance and functionality to determine the best structure for the program’s needs.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

Difficulties that I found included validating prerequisite data, handling invalid input, and making sure the correct binary search tree traversal. I was able to accomplish these issues by breaking the code into smaller functions, verifying results with traversal outputs, and adding validation logic to verify the code executes correctly.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

The projects helped me choose data structures based on the problem’s requirements rather than defaulting to what I’m most familiar with. I developed a stronger ability to evaluate performance trade offs and design for scalability.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

After completing the course I now focus more on writing modular as well as clearly documented code with consistent formatting. I also focus my design functions to minimize dependencies, which can allow for easier updates and swapping out one data structure for another without significant rewrites.
